# RestAssured-VS-Retrofit
## About
It's a tiny API testing project aiming for a comparison of the [RestAssured](https://rest-assured.io) and [Retrofit2](https://square.github.io/retrofit) libraries. The project has two test classes: *RestAssuredTests* and *RetrofitTests* with the corresponding content. Each class has two tests of equal functionality, one test creates a new 'Pet' resource via the POST request with the predefined ID and another test verifies that the resource with this ID exists and has the expected data via the GET request. The order of tests execution is important here, the test with the GET should follow after the test with POST otherwise it will fail.

## Tech Stack
* Java 11
* Gradle 7.1
* JUnit 5
* Rest Assured 4.4.0
* Retrofit 2.9.0

## How to run
You can run the tests directly in your Java IDE if it has the JUnit plugin (usually it does) or via the following commands from the command line in the project's root folder:
To run all the tests:
```
./gradlew clean test
```
or to run a specific class of tests:
```
./gradlew clean test --tests={name of desired test class}
```
e.g.: 
```
./gradlew clean test --tests=RestAssuredTests
```

# selenide-cucumber-demo
## About
It's a small UI testing project that stands to show perks of [Selenide](https://selenide.org) library usage instead of pure Selenium. The project is based on a usual Cucumber structure and Cucumber reporting. 

## Tech Stack
* Java 11
* Gradle 7.1
* JUnit 5
* Selenide 5.24.0
* Cucumber 6.11.0

## How to run
You can run the tests directly in your Java IDE (if it has the JUnit plugin) in the *feature* files from the */src/test/resources/features* folder. Or from the command line in the project's root folder:
To run all the tests:
```
./gradlew clean test
```

By default, the tests are run in the Chrome browser (if you have it) and in UI mode (non-headless) but you can specify the desired browser (should be supported by Selenium WebDriver) via the following parameter:
```
-Dselenide.browser={desired browser}
```
e.g.:
```
./gradlew clean test -Dselenide.browser=safari
```
The same for the browser Headless mode, it can be enbled via the following parameter:
```
-Dselenide.headless=true
```

## Test Repport
The report generated by Cucumber is available in the *\reports* folder and it also posted on the [Cucumber Report Portal](https://reports.cucumber.io), see for the link in the in console.

# selenide-allure-cucumber-demo
## About
This is another vesrion of the project above that still uses Cucumber together with [Selenide](https://selenide.org) but now also with [Allure Report](https://github.com/allure-framework).

## Tech Stack
* Java 11
* Maven 3.8.2
* TestNG 7.4.0
* Cucumber 6.11.0
* Selenide 5.24.0
* Allure 2.15.0

## How to run
You can run the tests directly in your Java IDE (if it has the TestNG plugin) in the *EquitiesScenarios* class from the */src/test/Scenarios* package. Or from the command line in the project's root folder:
To run all the tests:
```
mvn clean test
```

## Test Repport
You have to install the Allure binary to your local system to be able to see the Allure Report, please look into installation details [here](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2). The report should be called via the *'allure serve'* command from the *target/allure-results* folder, if everything is installed properly it will automatically open in your browser.

# selenide-allure-demo
## About
Here is another small UI testing project that should represent most benefits of using [Selenide](https://selenide.org) and [Allure Report](https://github.com/allure-framework) and how BDD can be achived without Cucumber use.

## Tech Stack
* Java 11
* Gradle 7.1
* TestNG 7.4.0
* Selenide 5.24.0
* Allure 2.14.0

## How to run
You can run the tests directly in your Java IDE (if it has the TestNG plugin) in the *EquitiesScenarios* class from the */src/test/Scenarios* package. Or from the command line in the project's root folder:

## Test Repport
You have to install the Allure binary to your local system to be able to see the Allure Report, please look into installation details [here](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2). The report should be called via the *'allure serve'* command from the *build/allure-results* folder, if everything is installed properly it will automatically open in your browser.
